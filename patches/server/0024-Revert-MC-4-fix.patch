Subject: [PATCH] Revert MC-4 fix

When messing around with collisions, I ran into problems where
entity position was off by ULP and that caused clipping problems.
Now, the collision epsilon is 1.0e-7 to account for those errors.

But this patch is going to cause problems on the order of 1.0e-4.

I do not want to deal with clipping problems. The very fact it works
shows it's causing the clipping to occur serverside.
